# Development Mode Configuration

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Implemented**

### **Email Alert Disabling**
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects local development automatically via hostname/protocol
- **Console Logging**: Clear development mode indicators in browser console  
- **Email Simulation**: Shows what emails would have been sent without actually sending
- **Production Safe**: Only disables emails in development, production remains unchanged

### **Visual Indicators**  
- **Dev Mode Badge**: Orange badge in top-right corner showing "üõ†Ô∏è DEV MODE - Emails Disabled"
- **Console Groups**: Organized console output for better debugging experience
- **Email Simulation**: Detailed logging of what emails would have been sent

### **Detection Logic**
Development mode is automatically active when:
- `hostname === 'localhost'`
- `hostname === '127.0.0.1'` 
- `protocol === 'file:'`

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser - development mode auto-activated
http://localhost:8000/
```

### **Testing**
```bash
# All tests run in development mode automatically
npx playwright test

# Tests confirm email alerts are disabled
‚úÖ Email alerts disabled in dev mode
‚úÖ Development mode confirmed
```

### **Production**
No changes needed - emails work normally when deployed to production domains.

## üìß **Email Alert Behavior**

### **Development Mode**
```javascript
üìß Email Alert (Development Mode)
Status: SKIPPED - Development mode active  
Recipient: jared_ambrose@gse.harvard.edu
User: John Doe
Timestamp: 8/6/2025, 12:48:28 PM
```

### **Production Mode**  
Emails sent normally via EmailJS to configured recipient.

## ‚úÖ **Benefits**
- **No Accidental Emails**: Safe local development without triggering real notifications
- **Full Functionality**: All other features work identically to production
- **Clear Indicators**: Always know when you're in development mode
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatically detects development environment
- **Production Safe**: Zero impact on production deployment
