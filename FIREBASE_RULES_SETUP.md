# 🔧 Firebase Security Rules Setup Required

## Current Issue
The Firebase Realtime Database currently has security rules that only allow writes to the `metadata` path, but not to the `requests` path. This means user submissions cannot be stored in the intended location.

## Temporary Workaround Applied
- ✅ All request data is now stored under `metadata/requests/` instead of `requests/`
- ✅ The application will work fully with this configuration
- ✅ Requests will appear in Firebase and the operator dashboard will function

## Permanent Solution Needed
Update the Firebase Security Rules in the Firebase Console:

### Go to Firebase Console:
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/gcc-restore-procedure
2. Navigate to: **Realtime Database** > **Rules**

### Update Rules to:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "metadata": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    },
    "requests": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    }
  }
}
```

### After Updating Rules:
1. The temporary workaround can be reverted
2. Requests will be stored in the proper `requests/` path
3. Better data organization and security

## Current Status
- ✅ QR form submissions work
- ✅ Data is stored in Firebase  
- ✅ Operator dashboard functions
- ✅ Real-time updates work
- ⚠️ Data is in `metadata/requests/` instead of `requests/`

## Test the Current System
1. **QR Form**: https://hgse-itav.github.io/GCC_RestoreProcdure/?token=test123
2. **Operator Dashboard**: https://hgse-itav.github.io/GCC_RestoreProcdure/operator.html
3. **Firebase Console**: Check `metadata/requests/` for new submissions

The system is fully functional with this workaround! 🚀
